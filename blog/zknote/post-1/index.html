If one of the elements does not have a preimage, that is okay, but if more than one element in the domain maps to the same element, it is not injective. We can also say that if an output element has a preimage, then it is unique.<p>A surjective function means the elements in the codomain has <em>at least</em> one preimage.

That is, the group operation is commutative. With addition as an operation, the integers and the real numbers form abelian groups, and the concept of an abelian group may be viewed as a generalization of these examples.</div></div></section>
