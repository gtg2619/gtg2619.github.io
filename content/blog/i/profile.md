description: Something about me.
---

I'm Zihao Wang, an undergraduate students of the [Hangzhou Dianzi University](https://en.hdu.edu.cn)(2022 -). Sometimes playing CTFs with [0RAYS](https://0rays.club) or [Nu1L](https://www.nu1l.com/). And [here](/blog/i/sawards/)'s some selected awards with other teams.

Here I mainly record some notes related to blockchain security and cryptography. Maybe I will write some personal thoughts in the future.:thinking:

Due to some minor psychological challenges, I tend to be timid, introverted, and struggle with verbal expression. However, growing up in a loving Christian family has provided me with a nurturing environment. Please forgive me if my words unintentionally come across as hurtful; I rarely harbor any ill intentions towards others.:hugs:

If you want to contact me or point out my mistakes, welcome to contact me using the Gmail address or telegram link on the homepage.:smiley_cat:
