description: Something about me.
---

I'm Zihao Wang, an undergraduate students of the [Hangzhou Dianzi University](https://en.hdu.edu.cn). Sometimes playing CTFs with [0RAYS](https://0rays.club). 

Here I mainly record some notes related to blockchain security and cryptography. Maybe I will write some personal thoughts in the future.:thinking:

Because I have experienced some minor psychological problems, I am timid, introverted and not good at words. But thanks to the fact that my family and I are Christians, I grew up in a loving environment - so please forgive me for any inadvertent offense I may have made with my words. I never intentionally offend anyone.
